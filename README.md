What is eZ Publish?
-------------------
**eZ Publish has made it beyond it's end of life in 2021 and survived. Current releases are primarily aimed at easing the requirements to support current versions of the PHP language like PHP 8.2 and 8.3.**

eZ Publish is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS
(content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

eZ Publish is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.
